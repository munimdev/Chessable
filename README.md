# Project Description

Chessable is a project that uses a large database of grandmaster games to store different information about chess games such as its event, players, average rating, opening, and game moves played etc. The main goal of this project was to use data structures in the most efficient way to store this data â€“ and apply certain operations on this data to extract useful information out of it.

An example of one of the functions that was implemented in this project is a function that takes as input a set of chess moves and then outputs the most played move by chess grandmasters after that certain position appears on a chess board.
